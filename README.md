# FeelTunes
An emotion based Music recommender system.

It detects how you're feeling using it's custom trained model, and then suggests some of the best suited songs from it's huge song database, and some help from our friends at spotify (someone's gotta play the music too right!)

To run the final code, just clone this repo into your system, and ensure that you have Python installed. Then run the `FeelTunes.py` file


For the model, refer to the EmotionDetection.ipynb
